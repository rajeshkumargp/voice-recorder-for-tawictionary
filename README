Voice Recorder for Tamil Wiktionary
===================================

Wiktionary.org is a wikipedia project to provide the dictionary service for words.

http://ta.wiktionary.org provides Tamil meaning for English words.


Check this page:
http://ta.wiktionary.org/wiki/tiny

It shows the word, gives its meaning in tamil and has an audio file link, on how to pronounce it.
We can click the file and play it to hear the pronounciation.

Tamil Wiktionary has around one lakh words.
only few words have the audio files to hear them.

To add an audio file in the wiktionary page,
1. see the word
2. read it and record in ogg format
3. upload to wikipedia commons
4. link in the same page for the audio file.

Doing these will be a boring task to do them all manually.

Think of a system, 
which shows you a word, 
you spell it.
it records it as ogg.
uploads to commons
links it to the wiktionary page.

Your only task is to spell it.


We can do this system using python.

Here is the small application which does the above said.

see in action.
